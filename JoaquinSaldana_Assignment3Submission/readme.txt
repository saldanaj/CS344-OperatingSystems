Assignment 3 / Smallsh 

Instructions on how to compile program: 

In order to compile the program you will need to run the makefile included in the zipfile.  

Just ensure the makefile is in the same directory as the smallsh.c file.  Type "make" in the command line, and it should 
compile the program.  Afterwards just run the executable as normal.  

Furthermore, I included a clean statement in the makefile so any .o object files created are cleaned after compile time 
and execution.  

If you have any questions pleas feel free to contact me directly.  

Thank you.
